# BFS-Cpp - need fixing

This is BFS algorithm in C++ to find the shortest path between start and end point in a binary maze and give the coordinates of the steps taken.

The binary maze consists of 1s and 0s, where 0 is a path available and 1 represents a wall. 

The script returns the co-ordinates of the shortest path taken from the set start and end points.
