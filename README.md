# BFS-Cpp

This is BFS algorithm in C++ to find the shortest path between start and end point in a binary maze and give the coordinates of the steps taken.

eg, if we have a matrix:

{1011010
1011111
1000111
1110111}

Where 0 is a path available and 1 represents a wall, the script returns the co-ordinates of the shortest path taken.
